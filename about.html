    This is such a common thing with developers. One of the major reasons why Monday's seem frustrating. 
    However, a well commented and beautiful code like this goes a long way in overcoming the frustration.

            Worked under Prof. Premkumar Natarajan in the capacity of a student worker. I was a part of the team that started off reasearch efforts on a new project on Neural Query based Abstractive Text Summarization. As a part of the research group I got a chance to foray into the field of Deep Learning. Familiarized myself with internal workings of a Feed Forward Neural Network and also learnt about RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs. Did a lot of literature survey and successfully ran the Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Summarization (NAMAS) by Facebook.

            Worked as a developer in the team responsible for handling the entire backend infrastructure for the largest Indian consumer tech company. Developed and worked on a lot of services to ensure reliable infrastructure having under 5 millisecond latency and 4 9â€™s of availability, delivering over billion messages a day. Led some major refactoring efforts for the codebases supporting Last Seen and Group Messaging functionalities in the application.

            As an intern @Hike Messenger, I majorly worked on messaging proxy solution from scratch that would prevent dropping of user connections on server restarts thus improving end user experience and providing seamless deployments of server components. Also, I familiarised myself with internals of Docker and what containerised systems are and thus helped setup 
            a developer environment for personalised testing by individual developers on the team.
